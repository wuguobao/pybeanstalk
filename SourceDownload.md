The source for this project is no longer being kept in the Google Code subversion repositories. We have moved it to github, since git (and most DVCS) allows for better open source workflow.  Everything else will be kept here (wiki, issue tracking etc).

To get the latest source do a:
```
git clone git://github.com/sophacles/pybeanstalk.git
```

Or checkout the github page http://github.com/sophacles/pybeanstalk/tree/master
