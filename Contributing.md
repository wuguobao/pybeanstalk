# Contributing #
This is a pretty standard open-source project. Contributions are always welcome and desired.  A few guidelines/requests for contributors are outlined below.

## Code ##
If you would like to contribute code to this project, please do so in the form of a unified or git diff that I can apply to the git trunk, or in the form of a github pull request.  As noted in the source tab, the code repository is hosted on
[github](http://github.com/sophacles/pybeanstalk/tree/master)

Please:
  * roughly follow [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  * be willing to explain your code if I ask

## Bugs/Feature requests ##
  * Please use the googlecode [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/pybeanstalk/issues/list) for this project
  * If possible include the generated error, and how to reproduce it
  * For feature requests, I will most likely ask questions, make comments, etc to the googlecode issue itself, so please keep an eye on it.

## Documentation ##
I think Googlecode currently only allows project members to edit wiki pages, so email me documentation and I will add/edit the appropriate page. If I'm wrong about my above assumption, edit away!

## Other ##
If there are other ways of contributing I haven't mentioned above, email me about them.

# Licensing #
Currently pybeanstalk is listed as a GPL v3 project.  I will most likely be changing this to a dual licensing, GPL v3 and BSD scheme in the near future.  Contributing code to this project for inclusion implies that you agree with this decision.
